Abstract:
In this paper, an extended priority list method combined with discrete heuristic search is proposed to solve the multi-objective unit commitment (MOUC) problem. First, the modeling framework of MOUC with the valve point effect is constructed. Then, the extended priority list method is designed to determine the on/off status of units. Techniques including adjustment from cold start to hot start and the shutdown of redundant units are adopted to keep the diversity of solutions and improve the probability of finding optimal solutions. Moreover, the A algorithm is adopted to perform multi-objective economic dispatch, and the optimization problem is solved by optimizing the nodes in the state space. The proposed method is tested on a 10-unit system for a 24-hour scheduling time span. Simulation results indicate the superiority of the proposed method in solving MOUC problems.
