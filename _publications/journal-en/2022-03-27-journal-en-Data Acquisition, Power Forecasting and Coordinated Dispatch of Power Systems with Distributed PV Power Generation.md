Abstract:
The integration of photovoltaic (PV) power generation with highly random and intermittent characteristics has posed significant challenges to the safe and economic operations of power systems. This paper establishes an entire operation structure covering PV data acquisition, PV power forecasting, and coordinated dispatch of power systems with large-scale behind-the-meter distributed PV units. The PV data acquisition method provides training data for the power forecasting model, and then the forecasting results serve as the references for developing coordinated dispatch strategies. Real-world systems and numerical studies validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed operation structure.
