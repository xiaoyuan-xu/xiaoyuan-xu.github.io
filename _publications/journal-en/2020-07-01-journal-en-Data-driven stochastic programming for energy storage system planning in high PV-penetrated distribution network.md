Abstract:
Energy storage systems (ESSs) facilitate the reliable and economic operation of distribution systems with high PV penetration. Establishing uncertainty models is the key to the optimal planning and operation of ESSs in distribution systems. Widely used parametric models cannot describe the variability of uncertainties thoroughly. In this paper, a data-driven method is designed for uncertainty modeling, and a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model is developed to determine the optimal ESS planning strategy in distribution systems. First, a deterministic optimization model is established considering both ESS planning and distribution system operation. Then, the Wasserstein-metric-based ambiguity set is designed for the probability distributions of random variables. To hedge against the distributional ambiguity, the optimization problem is expanded into a two-stage DRO problem, of which the second-stage problem minimizes the expected operating cost under the worst-case probability distribution. Finally, the two-stage DRO model is reformulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) problem, which is solved by optimization solvers. The proposed method is tested on modified 33-bus and 123-bus distribution systems with actual solar irradiance and load data. The influence of different strategies on ESS planning and operation is discussed. The ESS planning results obtained by DRO are compared with those of conventional stochastic optimization and deterministic optimization to verify the superiority of the proposed method.
