Abstract:
The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) and the increasing interdependence across power distribution networks (DNs) and transportation networks (TNs) have increased the complexity and vulnerability of the two systems in extreme circumstances. As the interdependence of two infrastructures tightens over time, it is viewed as a dire necessity to strengthen the resilience of the coordinated transportation-power distribution networks (TDNs) against natural disasters. This paper constructs a coordinated optimization method of TN traffic link reversing, DN line switching, and fast charging pile management, to improve the TDN performance in the emergency response stage after disasters. A dynamic TN model and a multi-period DN model are integrated in TDN modeling to capture flow propagations and state variations among time intervals. The coordinated optimization for TDN emergency response is designed as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with high-order objective functions and nonlinear constraints to minimize TN travel costs and DN active and reactive power shortages. An accuracy-aware adaptive piecewise linearization approach combined with Gray code-based encoding is utilized to improve the computational efficiency for solving the TDN optimization problem. Numerical simulations show that the TDN performance is enhanced by coordinating various DN and TN resources, as compared with those of separate and conventional topology controls. The proposed TDN solution method has significantly reduced the computation time for managing extreme conditions while guaranteeing the accuracy of the results as compared with those of the nonlinear model and the linearized model by uniform piecewise linearization.
