Abstract:
The ac-dc hybrid distribution network is a credible path for the future evolution of distribution network. State estimation is a paramount foundation for the safe and stable operation of the complex distribution network. The application of the centralized state estimation method in an ac-dc distribution network has some obstacles, such as low computational efficiency, large communication capacity, and privacy protection problem. Based on the three-stage state estimation theory, this paper established a three-stage state estimation model for the ac-dc hybrid distribution network integrating supervisory control and data acquisition system and phasor measurement unit. The proposed three-stage estimation model achieves linearization of the nonlinear state estimation for the ac-dc hybrid distribution network. That is, the first and third stages simply solve the linear state estimation problem, and the second stage is a one-step nonlinear transform. Moreover, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is applied to solving the distributed problem. Thus, an accurate and efficient three-stage distributed state estimation method for the ac-dc hybrid distribution network is proposed. In this method, ac subsystems and dc subsystems execute state estimation tasks based on local information and eventually achieve the overall consistency of the system state estimation through the transfer iteration of the boundary information, respectively. The combination of bilinear theory and ADMM ensures the convergence of distributed state estimation while improving computational efficiency. The simulation results verified the advantage of the proposal over the existing methods in many aspects.
