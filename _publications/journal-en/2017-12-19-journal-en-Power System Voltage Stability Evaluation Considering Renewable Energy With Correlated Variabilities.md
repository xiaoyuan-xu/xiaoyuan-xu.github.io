Abstract:
Power system operation will encounter numerous variabilities as the proliferation of renewable energy continues. Such random events will require the evaluation of corresponding variables and the assessment of their impacts on the monitoring and the control of stochastic power systems. In this paper, a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method is proposed to perform a priority ranking of renewable energy variabilities that will affect the voltage stability of power systems. First, a probabilistic model for the load margin calculation is presented considering the renewable power generation. Then, GSA is applied to models with correlated random input variables and the importance index is designed for evaluating the impacts of such variables. Next, the stochastic response surface method is adopted in GSA to improve the computation efficiency of the proposed evaluation method. Finally, the overall procedure is presented to identify critical variables that can affect the variability of load margins in voltage stability analyses. The proposed method is applied to power systems with a large penetration of renewable power and the influences of critical variabilities on voltage stability are analyzed. In this paper, the proposed method is tested using the IEEE 9-bus and the IEEE 118-bus systems, and its accuracy is compared with those of the local sensitivity analysis method and the commonly used GSA methods.
